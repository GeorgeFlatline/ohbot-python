Functions
-------

ohbot.move(m,pos,speed = 3)
----------


| Name| Range| Description | Defualt |
| --- |------|-------------|---------|
| m   | 0-6 (int)  | Motor Number| - |
| pos | 0-10 (int)  | Desired Postition| - |
| speed | 0-10 (int) | Motor Speed| 3 |


For Example:
```python
ohbot.move(1,7)
```
or
```python
ohbot.move(2,3,1) 
```
Motor index reference:

| m | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| ----| --- | --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |
| motor | HeadNod | HeadTurn | EyeTurn | LidBlink | TopLip | Bottom Lip| EyeTurn | 
  

ohbot.say(text,untilDone = True,lipSync = True)
----------

| Name| Range| Description | Defualt |
| --- |------|-------------|---------|
| text   | 'A string with no punctuation'  | Words to say| - |
| untilDone | bool  | Return when finished speaking| True |
| lipSync | bool | Move lips in time with speech| True |


For Example:
```python
ohbot.say('Hello I am Ohbot')

ohbot.say('Goodbye',False,False)
```
---

ohbot.wait(seconds)
----------

Seconds - float or int required wait time. ohbot.wait(1.5)

| Name| Range| Description  |
| --- |------|-------------|
| seconds   | float or int  | Length of wait in seconds|



For Example:
```python
ohbot.wait(2)

ohbot.wait(0.5)
```

*Note: It is important to use ohbot.wait() commands between motor sequential commands for the same motor.*

For Example:
```python
ohbot.move(1,7,2)

ohbot.wait(2)

ohbot.move(1,4,2)
```
---

ohbot.eyeColour(r,g,b)
----------

Set the colour of Ohbot’s eyes. 

| Name| Range| Description  |
| --- |------|-------------|
| r   | 0-10 (int)  | Red|
| g   | 0-10 (int)  | Green|
| b   | 0-10 (int)  | Blue|


For Example:
```python
ohbot.eyeColour(2,3,8)
```
---

ohbot.reset()
----------

Resets Ohbot’s motors back to rest positions and turns off Ohbot’s eyes. Useful to start programs with this. 

For Example:
```python
ohbot.reset()
ohbot.move(1,7,2)
ohbot.wait(1)
ohbot.move(1,1)
...
```
---

ohbot.close()
----------

Call at the end of your program to detach Ohbot’s motors.

For Example:
```python
ohbot.move(1,7,2)
ohbot.wait(1)
ohbot.move(1,1)
